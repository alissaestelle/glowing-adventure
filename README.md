#### **_Description_**
##### This blog is my first MERN project that I made during my sixth week in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. The goal for this project was to successfully build a full-stack web application that could perform full CRUD operations. This blog site is designed to create, edit, and delete posts, as well as view older articles. Blog posts stored in the database can be returned via axios calls triggered by user searches.
